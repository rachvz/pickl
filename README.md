**P**laywright **I**ntegrated with **C**ucumber **K**ickoff **L**aunchpad

PICKL is a modern BDD test automation boilerplate that combines Playwright's powerful browser automation with Cucumber's human-readable Gherkin syntax. Built with TypeScript and ESM, it provides everything you need to write, run, and maintain scalable end-to-end tests.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Fork the repository first on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PICKL.git
cd PICKL

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers (required!)
npx playwright install

# Create your local environment file
cp .env.example .env    # Mac/Linux
copy .env.example .env  # Windows

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run smoke tests
npm test -- --tags @smoke

# Run specific feature
npm test -- test/features/login.feature

# Generate report
npm run report

# Clean up artifacts and caches
npm run clean:all
```

### ⚠️ Windows Users: Line Ending Configuration

If you're on Windows and encounter ESLint errors about CRLF line endings, configure Git to use LF:

```bash
# Configure Git to not convert line endings
git config core.autocrlf false

# Normalize all files in the repository
git add --renormalize .

# Commit the normalized files
git commit -m "chore: normalize line endings to LF"

# Push the changes to your current branch
git push origin HEAD
```

**Why this is needed:**

- PICKL enforces Unix-style line endings (LF) for consistency across platforms
- `.gitattributes` and `.editorconfig` automatically handle this for new files
- Existing clones need the above commands to normalize their files
