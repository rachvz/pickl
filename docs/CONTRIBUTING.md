## Setting Up for Development

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: v22.22.0 or higher (check `.nvmrc`)
2. **Git**: Latest version
3. **VS Code**: Recommended IDE with extensions (see `.vscode/extensions.json`)

### Initial Setup

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING-STARTED.md). Quick summary:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jedau/PICKL.git
cd PICKL

# Install Node.js version (if using nvm)
nvm install
nvm use

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Create your local environment file
cp .env.example .env    # Mac/Linux
copy .env.example .env  # Windows

# Verify setup
npm test

# Generate report
npm run report
```

**About `.env` vs `.env.example`:**

- **`.env.example`** - Template committed to Git with safe default values
- **`.env`** - Your personal config (gitignored, never committed)
- The `.env` file lets you customize settings locally without affecting other contributors
- Default values work out of the box - no modifications needed unless customizing

**Git Hooks Setup:**

Git hooks are automatically installed when you run `npm install` (via the `prepare` script). These hooks will:

- Prevent direct commits to the `main` branch
- Run linting and formatting on staged files before commits
- Validate commit message format

To verify hooks are installed:

```bash
ls -la .husky/
# Should see: pre-commit, commit-msg
```

### VS Code Workspace Configuration

PICKL includes comprehensive VS Code workspace settings to enhance your development experience. The workspace is pre-configured with:

#### Workspace Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)

The project includes optimized settings for:

- **Auto-formatting** on save with Prettier
- **ESLint** auto-fix on save
- **Import organization** automatically
- **Consistent editor behavior** (tabs, line endings, rulers)
- **Optimized search** excluding `node_modules` and test artifacts
- **Cucumber integration** for Gherkin files

#### Debug Configurations (`.vscode/launch.json`)

Five debugging configurations are available via the Debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D / Cmd+Shift+D):

1. **Debug Current Feature File** - Debug the currently open `.feature` file
   - Opens browser in headed mode (HEADLESS=false)
   - Stops at breakpoints in step definitions
   - **Usage:** Open a `.feature` file and press **F5** (or click the green play button in Run and Debug panel)
   - **Example:** Open `test/features/login.feature`, set breakpoint in `test/steps/login.steps.ts`, press F5 or use Run and Debug

2. **Debug All Tests** - Debug all test suites
   - Runs entire test suite with debugger attached
   - Useful for investigating issues across multiple features
   - **Usage:** Select "Debug All Tests" from debug dropdown, press **F5** (or click the green play button)

3. **Debug Specific Scenario (by line)** - Debug a single scenario
   - Opens the feature file
   - Place cursor on any line within the scenario you want to debug
   - Press **F5** (or click the green play button) to debug only that scenario
   - **Usage:** Open `.feature` file → Click on scenario line → Press **F5** or use Run and Debug

4. **Debug with Tag** - Debug tests matching a specific tag
   - Prompts you to select a tag: `@smoke`, `@positive`, `@negative`, `@regression`, `@fail`, `@skip`
   - Runs all tests matching the selected tag
   - **Usage:** Select "Debug with Tag" from dropdown → Press **F5** (or click green play button) → Select tag from prompt
   - You can also type custom tag expressions like `@smoke and @positive` or `not @skip`

5. **Attach to Node Process** - Attach to running Node process
   - For advanced debugging scenarios
   - Use when manually starting tests with `--inspect` or `--inspect-brk` flag

#### Debugging Tips

**Setting Breakpoints:**

- Click the left gutter (line numbers area) in step definition files to set breakpoints
- Breakpoints work reliably in **step definition files** (`test/steps/**/*.ts`)
- Breakpoints in **page object files** (`pages/**/*.ts`) may not work due to TypeScript transpilation

**Debugging Keyboard Shortcuts:**

- **F5** - Start debugging / Continue execution
- **F10** - Step Over (execute current line, move to next)
- **F11** - Step Into (go inside function calls)
- **Shift+F11** - Step Out (exit current function)
- **Ctrl+Shift+F5** - Restart debugging
- **Shift+F5** - Stop debugging

**Debugging Page Objects:**
Since breakpoints in page objects don't always work reliably, use **F11 (Step Into)** from a step breakpoint:

```typescript
// test/steps/login.steps.ts
When('I enter username {string}', async function (username: string) {
  const loginPage = new LoginPage(this.page)
  await loginPage.enterUsername(username) // <-- Set breakpoint here, press F11 to step into
})
```

Press **F11** on the `enterUsername()` call to step into the page object method.

**Auto Attach Setting:**
For the best debugging experience, set VS Code's Auto Attach to **"Only With Flag"**:

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
2. Type: `"Debug: Toggle Auto Attach"`
3. Select **"Only With Flag"**

This ensures the debugger only attaches when using F5 or the Run and Debug panel, not during normal test runs.

#### Debugging FAQ

**Q: Why does "Waiting for the debugger to disconnect..." appear 3 times?**

A: This is normal! When debugging through npm scripts, VS Code attaches to each process in the chain:

- npm process
- tsx (TypeScript runtime) process
- cucumber.js process

Each shows the message when finishing. This is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality.

**Q: Why don't breakpoints work in my page object files?**

A: TypeScript transpilation with tsx makes source maps unreliable for page objects. Use **F11 (Step Into)** from a step definition breakpoint to debug into page objects, or add temporary `console.log()` statements.

**Q: Can I debug tests in headless mode?**

A: By default, debug configurations run with `HEADLESS=false` so you can see the browser. To debug in headless mode, edit `.vscode/launch.json` and change `"HEADLESS": "false"` to `"HEADLESS": "true"` for the configuration you're using.

**Q: How do I debug a test that's failing in CI but passing locally?**

A: Use the "Debug with Tag" configuration and select the tag used in CI (e.g., `@regression` or `@smoke`). You can also set `HEADLESS=true` in launch.json to match CI conditions more closely.

**Q: The debugger isn't stopping at my breakpoints.**

A: Ensure:

1. You set breakpoints in **step definition files** (`test/steps/**/*.ts`), not page objects
2. The feature file you're debugging actually executes that step
3. Auto Attach is set to "Only With Flag"
4. You're using F5 or the Run and Debug panel (not running `npm test` in terminal)

#### Tasks (`.vscode/tasks.json`)

Quick access to common commands via Terminal > Run Task (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task"):

- **Run Current Feature File** - Test the currently open feature file (Ctrl+Shift+B)
- **Run All Tests** - Execute complete test suite
- **Run Smoke Tests** - Execute only `@smoke` tagged tests
- **Generate Report** - Create HTML test report
- **Lint** - Run ESLint checks
- **Format** - Format all code with Prettier
- **Clean Test Results** - Remove test artifacts
- **Install Dependencies** - Run npm install
- **Verify Hooks** - Check git hooks status

**Quick Tip:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Cmd+Shift+B on Mac) to run the default task (Run Current Feature File).

### 🔗 Common Script Combinations

#### Pre-commit workflow

```bash
npm run lint           # Check for linting errors
npm run format         # Format all code
npm run test:smoke     # Run quick smoke tests
```

#### Full quality check before PR

```bash
npm run clean:all      # Clean all artifacts
npm run lint           # Check code quality
npm run format         # Format code
npm test               # Run full test suite
npm run report         # View test results
```

#### Cross-browser testing workflow

npm run report
```

#### CI/CD pipeline workflow

```bash
npm run clean:all      # Clean environment
npm run lint           # Code quality gate
npm run test:smoke     # Quick validation
npm test               # Full test suite
npm run report         # Generate results
```

**Cross-Platform CI Testing:**

The CI pipeline runs tests on multiple operating systems to ensure compatibility:

- **Ubuntu Latest** - Primary Linux environment
- **Windows Latest** - Windows compatibility
- **macOS Latest** - macOS compatibility

All tests must pass on all three platforms before merge. OS-specific artifacts (test results, screenshots, videos) are uploaded separately for each platform.

### 💡 Tips and Tricks

**1. Run specific feature files:**

```bash
npm test -- test/features/login.feature
```

**2. Run with custom tags:**

```bash
TAGS=@positive npm test
```

**3. Combine multiple tags:**

```bash
TAGS="@smoke and @positive" npm test
```

**4. Run in headed mode (see browser):**

```bash
HEADLESS=false npm test
```

**5. Debug tests with Playwright Inspector:**

```bash
PWDEBUG=1 npm test -- test/features/login.feature
```

**6. Run with debug logging:**

```bash
DEBUG=framework:*,test:* npm test
```

**7. Chain cleanup with specific browser:**

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Page Object

1. **Create the page class** in `pages/` directory:

```typescript
// pages/DropdownPage.ts
import { Page, Locator } from '@playwright/test'

/**
 * Page Object Model for the Dropdown page
 * URL: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown
 */
export class DropdownPage {
  readonly page: Page
  readonly dropdown: Locator

  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.page = page
    this.dropdown = page.locator('#dropdown')
  }

  /**
   * Navigate to the dropdown page
   */
  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto('/dropdown')
  }

  /**
   * Select an option from the dropdown
   * @param value - The value to select
   */
  async selectOption(value: string) {
    await this.dropdown.selectOption(value)
  }

  /**
   * Get the currently selected option
   * @returns The selected option text
   */
  async getSelectedOption(): Promise<string> {
    return (await this.dropdown.inputValue()) ?? ''
  }
}
```

2. **Create a feature file** in `test/features/`:

```gherkin
@smoke
Feature: Dropdown Selection
  As a user
  I want to select options from a dropdown
  So that I can choose from available options

  Background:
    Given I am on the dropdown page

  @positive
  Scenario: Select option 1 from dropdown
    When I select option "1" from the dropdown
    Then the selected option should be "1"
```

3. **Create step definitions** in `test/steps/`:

```typescript
// test/steps/dropdown.steps.ts
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
import { expect } from '@playwright/test'
import { ICustomWorld } from '../support/world.js'
import { DropdownPage } from '../../pages/DropdownPage.js'

Given('I am on the dropdown page', async function (this: ICustomWorld) {
  if (!this.page) {
    throw new Error('Page is not initialized')
  }

  const dropdownPage = new DropdownPage(this.page)
  await dropdownPage.goto()
})

When(
  'I select option {string} from the dropdown',
  async function (this: ICustomWorld, option: string) {
    if (!this.page) {
      throw new Error('Page is not initialized')
    }

    const dropdownPage = new DropdownPage(this.page)
    await dropdownPage.selectOption(option)
  },
)

Then(
  'the selected option should be {string}',
  async function (this: ICustomWorld, expectedOption: string) {
    if (!this.page) {
      throw new Error('Page is not initialized')
    }

    const dropdownPage = new DropdownPage(this.page)
    const selectedOption = await dropdownPage.getSelectedOption()
    expect(selectedOption).toBe(expectedOption)
  },
)
```

4. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm test -- test/features/dropdown.feature
   ```

### Adding Helper Utilities

Create reusable utilities in `test/utils/`:

```typescript
// test/utils/wait.ts
import { Page } from '@playwright/test'

/**
 * Wait for network to be idle
 */
export async function waitForNetworkIdle(page: Page, timeout = 30000): Promise<void> {
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle', { timeout })
}

/**
 * Wait for a specific number of milliseconds
 */
export async function wait(ms: number): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))
}
```

### Adding Custom Step Definition Helpers

To reduce duplication in step definitions, create helper functions:

```typescript
// test/support/step-helpers.ts
import { ICustomWorld } from './world.js'

/**
 * Get the page instance with validation
 */
export function getPage(world: ICustomWorld) {
  if (!world.page) {
    throw new Error('Page is not initialized')
  }
  return world.page
}

/**
 * Usage in step definitions:
 */
import { getPage } from '../support/step-helpers.js'

Given('I am on the dropdown page', async function (this: ICustomWorld) {
  const page = getPage(this)
  const dropdownPage = new DropdownPage(page)
  await dropdownPage.goto()
})
```

## Testing Best Practices

### Writing Good Feature Files

**DO:**

- ✅ Use descriptive scenario names
- ✅ Keep scenarios focused on one behavior
- ✅ Use Background for common setup steps
- ✅ Tag scenarios appropriately (@smoke, @regression, @positive, @negative)
- ✅ Write from the user's perspective

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Don't include implementation details in Gherkin
- ❌ Don't write scenarios that are too long (split them up)
- ❌ Don't use technical jargon in feature descriptions
- ❌ Don't duplicate scenarios unnecessarily

### Writing Step Definitions

**Best Practices:**

1. **Keep steps reusable:**

   ```typescript
   // Good - generic and reusable
   When('I enter {string} into the {string} field', async function (value, field) {
     // Implementation
   })

   // Less ideal - too specific
   When('I enter tomsmith into the username field', async function () {
     // Implementation
   })
   ```

2. **Use Page Objects:**

   ```typescript
   // Always use Page Objects in step definitions
   Given('I am on the login page', async function (this: ICustomWorld) {
     const page = getPage(this)
     const loginPage = new LoginPage(page)
     await loginPage.goto()
   })
   ```

3. **Handle errors gracefully:**
   ```typescript
   Then('I should see the success message', async function (this: ICustomWorld) {
     try {
       const page = getPage(this)
       const loginPage = new LoginPage(page)
       const message = await loginPage.getFlashMessage()
       expect(message).toContain('success')
     } catch (error) {
       // Attach screenshot on failure
       if (this.page) {
         const screenshot = await this.page.screenshot()
         this.attach(screenshot, 'image/png')
       }
       throw error
     }
   })
   ```

### Writing Page Objects

**Best Practices:**

1. **Declare locators as readonly properties:**

   ```typescript
   export class LoginPage {
     readonly usernameInput: Locator
     readonly passwordInput: Locator
   }
   ```

2. **Add JSDoc comments:**

   ```typescript
   /**
    * Enter username into the username field
    * @param username - The username to enter
    */
   async enterUsername(username: string) {
     await this.usernameInput.fill(username)
   }
   ```

3. **Create composite methods for common flows:**

   ```typescript
   /**
    * Perform complete login action
    */
   async login(username: string, password: string) {
     await this.enterUsername(username)
     await this.enterPassword(password)
     await this.clickLogin()
   }
   ```

4. **Use descriptive method names:**

   ```typescript
   // Good
   async getFlashMessage(): Promise<string>
   async isOnSecureArea(): Promise<boolean>

   // Less clear
   async getMessage(): Promise<string>
   async check(): Promise<boolean>
   ```

### Test Data Management

**Option 1: Feature File Examples**

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Login with different credentials
  When I enter username "<username>"
  And I enter password "<password>"
  Then I should see "<result>"

  Examples:
    | username    | password              | result  |
    | tomsmith    | SuperSecretPassword!  | success |
    | invaliduser | wrongpassword         | failure |
```

**Option 2: Test Data Files**

```typescript
// test/fixtures/testData.ts
export const TEST_USERS = {
  validUser: {
    username: 'tomsmith',
    password: 'SuperSecretPassword!',
  },
  invalidUser: {
    username: 'invaliduser',
    password: 'wrongpassword',
  },
}
```

## Code Quality Standards

PICKL enforces strict code quality standards through automated tools and CI/CD checks. All contributions must meet these standards before being merged.

### Quality Metrics

The project maintains the following quality thresholds:

| Metric                       | Threshold                                                  | Enforcement        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Test Coverage**            | Lines: 80%, Functions: 80%, Branches: 75%, Statements: 80% | ✅ CI blocks merge |
| **Cyclomatic Complexity**    | Max 10 per function                                        | ⚠️ Warning         |
| **Function Length**          | Max 50 lines (excluding blanks/comments)                   | ⚠️ Warning         |
| **Max Parameters**           | 4 parameters per function                                  | ⚠️ Warning         |
| **Max Nesting Depth**        | 3 levels                                                   | ⚠️ Warning         |
| **ESLint Errors**            | 0 errors                                                   | ✅ CI blocks merge |
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | 0 high/critical                                            | ✅ CI blocks merge |

### Code Quality Tools

**ESLint** - Linting and static analysis

- TypeScript strict rules
- Complexity checks
- Code smell detection
- Security pattern enforcement

**c8** - Test coverage tracking

- Line, branch, function, and statement coverage
- HTML and JSON reports generated in CI
- Coverage artifacts retained for 30 days

**CodeQL** - Security analysis

- Weekly security scans
- Vulnerability detection
- Security hotspot identification

**Prettier** - Code formatting

- Consistent style enforcement
- Runs automatically on commit via lint-staged

### Running Quality Checks Locally

**Linting:**

```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting errors
npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

**Test Coverage:**

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Check if coverage meets thresholds
npm run coverage:check

# View HTML coverage report (platform-specific)
open coverage/index.html              # macOS
xdg-open coverage/index.html          # Linux
start coverage/index.html             # Windows (Powershell or cmd)
# Or open coverage/index.html manually in your browser
```

**Full Quality Check:**

```bash
# Run everything before creating a PR
npm run lint        # Linting
npm run test        # Tests
npm run test:coverage  # Coverage
npm run coverage:check # Coverage validation
```

### TypeScript Standards

1. **Use strict typing:**

   ```typescript
   // Good
   async getFlashMessage(): Promise<string>

   // Avoid
   async getFlashMessage(): Promise<any>
   ```

2. **Use async/await consistently:**

   ```typescript
   // Good
   async clickLogin() {
     await this.loginButton.click()
   }

   // Avoid
   clickLogin() {
     return this.loginButton.click()
   }
   ```

3. **Handle null/undefined:**
   ```typescript
   async getFlashMessage(): Promise<string> {
     const text = await this.flashMessage.textContent()
     return text?.replace('×', '').trim() ?? ''
   }
   ```

### Linting and Formatting

Before committing, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting errors
npm run lint -- --fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

**Automated Git Hooks:**

This project uses Husky to automatically run quality checks before commits. The following hooks are configured:

1. **Pre-commit Hook** - Runs automatically when you commit:
   - ✅ Prevents direct commits to `main`/`master` branches
   - ✅ Runs ESLint with auto-fix on staged `.js`/`.ts` files
   - ✅ Runs Prettier on staged files (`.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.md`)
   - ❌ Blocks commit if checks fail

2. **Commit-msg Hook** - Validates commit message format:
   - ✅ Enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
   - ✅ Required format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
   - ✅ Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `revert`, `merge`
   - ❌ Blocks commit if message format is invalid

**Examples of valid commit messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(login): add remember me checkbox"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve timeout issue"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation steps"
git commit -m "test(checkboxes): add negative scenarios"
```

**What happens if you try to commit to main:**

```bash
$ git commit -m "feat: my changes"
❌ Direct commits to 'main' branch are not allowed!

💡 Please create a feature branch instead:
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

📚 See docs/BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md for branch naming conventions
```

**Bypassing hooks (not recommended):**

```bash
# Use --no-verify to skip hooks (only for emergencies)
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency fix"
```

**Verifying hook installation:**

After cloning the repository and running `npm install`, verify that git hooks are properly installed:

```bash
# Check if hooks are installed and configured correctly
npm run verify:hooks

# Expected output:
# 🎉 All git hooks are properly installed and configured!
#
# 📚 Hook Summary:
#    • pre-commit: Prevents commits to main/master, runs lint-staged
#    • commit-msg: Enforces Conventional Commits format
```

The `verify:hooks` script checks:

- ✅ `.husky` directory exists
- ✅ `pre-commit` hook exists with branch protection and lint-staged
- ✅ `commit-msg` hook exists with Conventional Commits validation
- ✅ `lint-staged` configuration is present in `package.json`

**Troubleshooting hooks:**

If hooks aren't working:

```bash
# Reinstall hooks
rm -rf .husky
npm install

# Verify installation
npm run verify:hooks
```

### Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code, check for:

- ✅ Follows naming conventions
- ✅ Includes appropriate comments/documentation
- ✅ Has tests covering new functionality
- ✅ No console.log statements (use debug logger instead)
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Uses existing utilities/helpers where applicable
- ✅ TypeScript types are specific (not `any`)
- ✅ Async operations use await
- ✅ Locators are readonly
- ✅ Methods have JSDoc comments
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or credentials (see [Secrets Management](SECRETS-MANAGEMENT.md))
- ✅ Environment variables used correctly
- ✅ `.env.example` updated if new variables added
